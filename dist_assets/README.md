## RUNNING THE SCRIPT

# Windows

You can run the script by double clicking the executable or opening it in your terminal of choice.

HOWEVER, there are many known bugs in the built in terminal (That cannot be fixed). It is highly recommended you use powershell instead of opening the executable via double click.

To open via powershell:
Hold shift and rightclick the empty space below the list of files, then click "Open PowerShell window here". Then run BoH-Helper by typing "./BoH-Helper.exe" and pressing enter.

# Linux/Mac

A binary is not yet created but running the code straight from Deno should work. "Deno task run"
